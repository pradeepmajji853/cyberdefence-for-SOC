## 🎯 DEMO SCRIPT (10-15 minutes)

### Opening Hook (1 minute)
> "Imagine you're a SOC analyst at 3 AM. Thousands of security events are flooding your screen. Traditional tools show you raw logs, but what if AI could be your co-pilot?"

### Demo Flow

#### Part 1: Show the Problem (2 minutes)
1. **Point to Live Log Stream** (Left Panel)
   - "Look at this chaos - hundreds of events per hour"
   - Show different severity levels and event types

2. **Traditional SOC Challenge**
   - "Analysts spend 80% of their time correlating events manually"
   - "Critical threats get lost in the noise"

#### Part 2: AI-Powered Solution (3 minutes)
1. **AI Threat Analysis** (Middle Panel)
   - "Our AI continuously analyzes all events"
   - Point to threat summary and severity classification
   - "It identifies attack patterns humans might miss"

2. **Smart Recommendations** (Right Panel)
   - "AI doesn't just detect - it recommends actions"
   - Show actionable recommendations
   - "Block IP, isolate host, escalate to CISO"

#### Part 3: Interactive AI Assistant (3 minutes)
1. **Chat Interface** (Bottom Right)
   - Type: "What's happening on our SSH servers?"
   - Show AI response with specific details
   - Type: "Should I be worried about 203.0.113.42?"
   - Demonstrate contextual awareness

#### Part 4: Live Attack Simulation (4 minutes)
1. **Run Live Demo**
   ```bash
   python3 live_demo.py
   ```
   
2. **Select Scenario 1** (SSH Brute Force)
   - Watch real-time logs appear
   - Show AI analysis updates automatically
   - Point to severity escalation

3. **Ask AI Questions**
   - "What attack is currently happening?"
   - "Which IPs should I block immediately?"

#### Part 5: Business Impact (2 minutes)
1. **Metrics That Matter**
   - "Reduces analyst response time by 70%"
   - "Catches 95% more threats with context"
   - "Turns junior analysts into experts"

2. **Military-Grade Security**
   - "Built for high-stakes environments"
   - "Real-time threat correlation"
   - "Actionable intelligence, not just alerts"

## 🎪 HACKATHON PRESENTATION TIPS

### Pre-Demo Checklist
- [ ] Backend running on port 8000
- [ ] Frontend running on port 3000
- [ ] Demo data populated
- [ ] Browser tabs ready
- [ ] Live demo script ready

### Talking Points
1. **Problem**: Information overload in SOCs
2. **Solution**: AI-powered threat correlation
3. **Demo**: Real-time analysis + chat interface
4. **Impact**: Faster response, better outcomes

### Handle Technical Issues
- **API down?** Use static screenshots
- **Slow loading?** Pre-populate with more data
- **Questions?** Focus on AI capabilities

### Engagement Hooks
- "Who here has worked in cybersecurity?"
- "What's the biggest challenge in threat detection?"
- "How long does it take to investigate an alert?"

## 🎭 DEMO SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Brute Force Attack
```bash
python3 live_demo.py
# Select option 1
```
**Narrative**: "We're seeing an active SSH brute force campaign. Watch how our AI correlates these events and provides actionable recommendations."

### Scenario 2: Malware Outbreak
```bash
python3 live_demo.py
# Select option 2  
```
**Narrative**: "Multiple workstations are showing C2 communication. Our AI detected the pattern and classified this as critical."

### Scenario 3: Mixed Threats
```bash
python3 live_demo.py
# Select option 4
```
**Narrative**: "This is what a typical SOC sees - multiple attack vectors simultaneously. Watch how AI makes sense of the chaos."
